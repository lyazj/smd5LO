# smd5LO

A BSM model and MC analysis based on it.

## Build

The building scripts are designed in general consideration, but till now only tuned and tested on PKU farm.

Tow points of interposition are forced to proceed in building:

* `make` -> `make -j${NCPU}` (for all libraries)
* `g++` -> `g++ -std=c++11 -fPIC` (for `lhapdf6` only)

Before building the project, please `source thisroot.sh`.

Then use `init_*` scripts to build corresponding versions of `MG5_aMC@NLO`.

Test scripts are produced as `test-*` to validate the built.

## Draw diagrams and generate events

The eps viewer of `MG5_aMC@NLO` has been set as `resource/diagram-saver` to save all figures to `${PWD}/diagrams` when executing `display diagrams` in `MG5_aMC@NLO`.

In directory `mumuwwhhjj`, a shortcut named `draw-diagrams` is provided for your convenience.

Before generating events, run `make-proc` to generate `proc` directory as output of `MG5_aMC@NLO` to share between subsequent runs.

Finishing with `proc`, for each node in the cluster, edit `run-proc`, properly setting event number and other options, then execute it.

Note that both `draw-diagrams` and `make-proc` refer to the script `gen-proc`, which is the only thing to be changed when switching to another process.

A useful script `list-run` is provided to show information about runs. Finished ones are output to fd=1 and additional information to fd=2.

For a fixed target number of events, try `loop-run`. To submit the task to specified nodes of the cluster, try `loop-all`. Please check twice the configuration of the two scripts before launching them.

## Plot statistical figures

An example routine for LHEF plotting is implemented by C++. Please use CMake to build the libraries and executables. CMake >= 3.13 is required, and could be installed conveniently with `pip3` after `scikit-build` is installed for corresponding `python3`. Before running CMake, make sure that `thisroot.sh` has been sourced by current shell.

Recommended ways to build the project:

```bash
cd <path-to-smd5LO>
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j<worker-number>
```

Any content enclosed by `<>` should be properly substituted according to the environment and the platform.

In this example, after building succeeds, for $pp \to HH\mu\mu jj$ process, try the following command to visualize LHE events: (`${PWD}` is assumed to be `<path-to-smd5LO>/build`)

```bash
../bin/plot-lhe ../mc/hhmumu/
```

## Tested environment

* CentOS 7: ROOT 6.24/06
* Ubuntu 22.04: ROOT 6.28/04
